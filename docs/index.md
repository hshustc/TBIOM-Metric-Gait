# TBIOM_Metric_Gait

###Update
- I am recently engaged in preparing the CVPR submission and taking care of my baby (^_^). I will clean up and release the code after the CVPR deadline in conjunction with OpenGait (https://github.com/ShiqiYu/OpenGait). The MHG dataset as well as the application form will be released simultaneously (2022-10-20).
- This paper is accepted by IEEE Transactions on Biometrics, Identity and Behavior. We sincerely thank the editors and reviewers for their time and efforts spent on our manuscript (2022-10-20).
